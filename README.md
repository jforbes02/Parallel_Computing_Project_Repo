# Parallel_Computing_Project_Repo
Repo for the Three projects needed for parallel computing class 
Project Instructions
For each of the following projects:
a. The first step is to write a serial code to solve the problem, then you will start writing the parallel code.
b. Provide a clear and organized documentation for the chosen project (for the source code and the mean ideas you followed to solve the problem). Your report should compare the performance of the serial and parallel codes against different inputs that vary in their size and difficulty, you should enrich your report with discussions, tables, figures, and charts.
c. Submit the source code, at least one screen shot of the execution, and the Documentation
d. The deadline is before the last week of the semester
e. Your project will be evaluated, so be prepared.
f. For undergraduate students: you should solve three projects, but you are welcome to solve more for extra credits. For graduate students you should solve four projects and you are welcome to solve more for extra credits.
g. Solve the projects you choose using MPI and Cuda, you can solve it using openMP for extra credits 
h. For undergraduate students a team of two students is allowed, for graduate students you should work alone.

Project Multiplying Matrices
Develop a project to implement a 2D matrix multiplication (matrix*matrix), the user will specify the number of row and columns for each matrix (), then your code shall perform the multiplication. The content of the two input matrices will be generated randomly, also the number of columns/rows is not always divisible by the number of cores. At the end of the multiplication, the content of the input and output shall be printed out.
